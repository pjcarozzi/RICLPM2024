	abstract = {The longitudinal causal relationships between individuals’ online and offline forms of civic participation requires further understanding. We provide a robust test of four competing theoretical perspectives to establish the di­ rection of causality between online political participation and offline collective action as well as the persistence of their longitudinal effects. Two longitudinal panel studies were conducted in the socio-political context of Chile. Study 1 involved university students (a 2-year, 5-wave longitudinal study, N wave 1 = 1221, N wave 2 = 954, N wave 3 = 943, N wave 4 = 905, and N wave 5 = 786) and Study 2 used a nationally representative sample of adults (a 3-year, 3-wave longitudinal study, N wave 1 = 2927, N wave 2 = 2473 and N wave 3 = 2229). Results from both studies supported the spillover perspective compellingly showing that offline participation fostered subsequent online collective action over time, whereas the reverse causal path from online political participation and offline collective action was consistently non-significant. In Study 2, previous offline collective action predicted increased online participation after controlling for the effects of age, gender, and educational level. The need for further fine-grained longitudinal research on the causal relations between offline and online collective action is discussed.},

	abstract = {The random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) is an extension of the traditional cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) that allows controlling for stable trait factors when estimating cross-lagged eﬀects. It has been argued that the RI-CLPM more appropriately accounts for trait-like, timeinvariant stability of many psychological constructs and that it should be preferred over the CLPM when at least three waves of measurement are available. The basic idea of the RI-CLPM is to decompose longitudinal associations between two constructs into stable between-person associations and temporal within-person dynamics. The present article critically examines the RI-CLPM from a causal inference perspective. Using formal analysis and simulated data, we show that the RI-CLPM has limited potential to control for unobserved stable confounder variables when estimating crosslagged eﬀects. The CLPM with additional lag-2 eﬀects suﬃciently controls for delayed eﬀects, as long as all relevant covariates are measured. Furthermore, we clarify that, in general, the RI-CLPM targets a diﬀerent causal estimand than the CLPM. Whereas the cross-lagged eﬀect in the CLPM targets the eﬀect of increasing the exposure by one unit, the within-person cross-lagged eﬀect in the RI-CLPM provides an estimate of the eﬀect of increasing the exposure by one unit around the person mean. We argue that this within-person causal eﬀect is typically less relevant for testing causal hypotheses with longitudinal data because it only captures temporary ﬂuctuations around the individual person means and ignores the potential eﬀects of causes that explain diﬀerences between persons.},

Although cross-lagged panel models suggest that Openness to Experience predicts decreases in conservatism, analyses that properly separate between-person stability from within-person change find no evidence to suggest that personality precedes ideology (or vice-versa). These findings raise concerns about a critical assumption in the literature and suggest that personality and political ideology develop in parallel with one another, rather than personality causally preceding conservatism.},

                The cross‐lagged panel (regression) model (
                CLPM
                ) is the usual framework of choice to test the longitudinal reciprocal effects between self‐concept and achievement. Criticisms of the
                CLPM
                are that causal paths are over‐estimated as they fail to discriminate between‐ and within‐person variation. The random‐intercept cross‐lagged panel model (
                RI
                ‐
                CLPM
                ) is one alternative that extends the
                CLPM
                by partialling out between‐person variance.
              
            
            
              Aims
              
                We compare analyses from a
                CLPM
                and a
                RI
                ‐
                CLPM
                which examine the reciprocal relationships between self‐concept, self‐efficacy, and achievement and determine the extent
                CLPM
                estimates are inflated by between‐person variance.
              
            
            
              Sample(s)
              
                Participants (
                n
                 = 314) were first‐year undergraduate psychology students recruited as part of the

              Methods
              Participants completed measures of self‐efficacy and self‐concept prior to completing fortnightly quiz assessments.
            
            
              Results
              
                Cross‐Lagged Panel (regression) Model estimates are likely over‐estimated in comparison with
                RI
                ‐
                CLPM
                estimates. Cross‐Lagged Panel (regression) Model analyses identified a reciprocal effects relationship between self‐concept and achievement, confirming established literature. In
                RI
                ‐
                CLPM
                analyses, these effects were attenuated and a skill development association between achievement and self‐concept was supported. A reciprocal relationship between self‐efficacy and achievement was supported. Better model fit was reported for the
                RI
                ‐
                CLPM

              Conclusions
              
                Prior findings relating to the reciprocal effects of self‐concept and achievement need to be reconsidered. Whilst such a relationship was supported in a
                CLPM
                analysis in this study, within an
                RI
                ‐
                CLPM
                framework, only achievement predicted self‐concept. However, in both
                CLPM
                and RI‐CLPM models a reciprocal effects model of self‐efficacy and achievement was supported.},

	abstract = {In virtually all areas of psychology, the question of whether a particular construct has a prospective effect on another is of fundamental importance. For decades, the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) has been the model of choice for addressing this question. However, CLPMs have recently been critiqued, and numerous alternative models have been proposed. Using the association between low self-esteem and depression as a case study, we examined the behavior of seven competing longitudinal models in 10 samples, each with at least four waves of data and sample sizes ranging from 326 to 8,259. The models were compared in terms of convergence, fit statistics, and consistency of parameter estimates. The traditional CLPM and the random intercepts cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) converged in every sample, whereas the other models frequently failed to converge or did not converge properly. The RI-CLPM exhibited better model fit than the CLPM, whereas the CLPM produced more consistent cross-lagged effects than the RI-CLPM. We discuss the models from a conceptual perspective, emphasizing that the models test conceptually distinct psychological and developmental processes, and address the implications of the empirical findings with regard to model selection. Moreover, we provide practical recommendations for researchers interested in testing prospective associations between constructs, and suggest using the CLPM when focused on between-person effects and the RI-CLPM when focused on within-person effects.},

In this article, we describe how common factors and cross-lagged parameters included in these models can be interpreted, using a unified framework that was recently developed. Because common factors are modeled with lagged effects in the GCLM, they have both direct and indirect influences on observed scores, unlike stable trait factors included in the RI-CLPM. This indicates that the GCLM does not control for stable traits as the RI-CLPM does, and that there are interpretative differences in cross-lagged parameters between these models. We also explain that including such common factors as well as moving-average terms in the GCLM makes this interpretation very complicated.},

To that end, this study uses data from one large-scale survey as a basis for examining the extent to which typical fit measures used in multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis are suitable for detecting measurement invariance in a large-scale survey context. Using measures validated in a smaller scale context and an empirically grounded simulation study, our findings indicate that many typical measures and associated criteria are either unsuitable in a large group and varied samplesize context or should be adjusted, particularly when the number of groups is large.

	abstract = {Across the globe, collective action has been a notable driver of social change. Previous research has identified numerous psychological antecedents of collective action participation, such as group efficacy. The mobilizing influence of social norms, however, has been comparatively neglected. Among a nationally representative Chilean sample (N = 3328), a three-­wave longitudinal study tested the relationship between the perceived frequency of family and friends’ participation in social movements (norms of close social networks) and change in the frequency of participants’ own engagement over time. Perceived efficacy of social movements to facilitate social change was tested as a mediator of this relationship. A fully constrained bidirectional cross-l­agged panel model revealed that norms of close social networks significantly predicted social-­movement participation over time. This longitudinal relationship was also significantly mediated by group efficacy. Direct reverse paths were also observed, with social-m­ ovement participation predicting norms of close social networks over time. Considering low degrees of political participation often seen in societies, these results suggest that utilizing the normative context to promote participation in social movements may prove fruitful in mobilizing the drive for social change.},

	abstract = {How to model cross-lagged relations in panel data continues to be a source of disagreement in psychological research. While the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) was the modeling approach of choice for many years, it has also been criticized repeatedly for its inability to separate within-person dynamics from stable betweenperson differences. Hence, various alternative models that disentangle these forms of variability have been proposed, and these are now rapidly gaining popularity. But not everyone agrees this is the right way forward. CLPM advocates point out that many psychological theories are concerned with longer-lasting differences between individuals, while these differences are not allowed to contribute to the estimation of cross-lagged effects in the novel within-between approaches. Reasoning this way, it is argued that the CLPM is superior when studying such processes, precisely because it includes the chronic between-person differences when estimating prospective effects. The goal of the current paper is to consider this within-between dispute in its broader context and to examine various directions in which this discussion needs expansion. To this end, three different perspectives are adopted: that of the study design, patterns in empirical data, and the nature of our research questions. It will be argued that to move forward, we need to look beyond the narrow focus on how to model our correlational panel data. Progress will involve theorizing more deliberately about the timescale that a process operates on, being more explicit about our research questions, considering alternative designs and models, and familiarizing ourselves with relevant discussions in other disciplines.},

	abstract = {The random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) is a popular model among psychologists for studying reciprocal effects in longitudinal panel data. Although various texts and software packages have been published concerning power analyses for structural equation models (SEM) generally, none have proposed a power analysis strategy that is tailored to the particularities of the RI-CLPM. This can be problematic because mismatches between the power analysis design, the model, and reality, can negatively impact the validity of the recommended sample size and number of repeated measures. As power analyses play an increasingly important role in the preparation phase of research projects, an RI-CLPM-specific strategy for the design of a power analysis is detailed, and implemented in the Rpackage powRICLPM. This paper focuses on the (basic) bivariate RI-CLPM, and extensions to include constraints over time, measurement error (leading to the stable trait autoregressive trait state model), non-normal data, and bounded estimation.},

In this essay, I focus on the assumptions needed to estimate mediation effects. I show that there is no ‘‘gold standard’’ method for the identification of causal mediation effects. In particular, mediation effects will always have the character of estimates from observational data since they are generally subject to a specific form of confounding. Additionally, I demonstrate how randomization of the mediator and instrumental variables methods lead to fundamentally different quantities than causal mediation analyses. I also review recent work that discusses how the assumptions of mediation analyses differ when there is treatment noncompliance or when there are multiple mediators. Throughout, I motivate concepts using path diagrams and an example of a classroom intervention designed to increase test scores.},

	abstract = {Researchers often combine longitudinal panel data analysis with tests of interactions (i.e., moderation). A popular example is the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM). However, interaction tests in CLPMs and related models require caution because stable (i.e., between-level, B) and dynamic (i.e., within-level, W ) sources of variation are present in longitudinal data, which can conﬂate estimates of interaction effects. We address this by integrating literature on CLPMs, multilevel moderation, and latent interactions. Distinguishing stable B and dynamic W parts, we describe three types of interactions that are of interest to researchers: 1) purely dynamic or WxW; 2) cross-level or BxW; and 3) purely stable or BxB. We demonstrate estimating latent interaction effects in a CLPM using a Bayesian SEM in Mplus to apply relationships among work-family conﬂict and job satisfaction, using gender as a stable B variable. We support our approach via simulations, demonstrating that our proposed CLPM approach is superior to a traditional CLPMs that conﬂate B and W sources of variation. We describe higher-order nonlinearities as a possible extension, and we discuss limitations and future research directions.},
